1.  Introduction

   The Semantic Definition Format for Data and Interactions of Things
   (SDF, [I-D.ietf-asdf-sdf]) is a format for domain experts to use in
   the creation and maintenance of data and interaction models in the
   Internet of Things.

   A common data type that occurs in the modeling of IoT devices is the
   _link_. [RFC8288] defines the concept of Web Linking, which
   complements the target URI that any link will contain, with
   additional parameters, such as the "link relation type" that explains
   the relationship expressed by the link, as well as "target
   attributes" that provide additional information about the target of
   the link (without a need to "dereference", i.e., follow, the link).

   This document defines and registers an sdfType "link" for the
   Semantic Definition Format.  This type models an abstract
   "serialization" [RFC8288] of a link, in a way that is compatible with
   the way SDF maps information models to its data modeling language.

1.1.  Conventions and Definitions

   The definitions of [RFC6690], [RFC8288], and [I-D.ietf-asdf-sdf]
   apply.

2.  The sdfType "link"

   The sdfType "link" is intended to be used with the SDF "type" of
   "object".  The members of that object are strings that are named the
   same as the link parameter (attribute) names.  The special parameter
   name "href" is used to express the link target.  (Parameter names
   specific to the Constrained RESTful Environment (CoRE) are also
   discussed in [RFC9423].)

   An example for the instance of a link is provided in Section 5 of
   [RFC6690]:

      </sensors/temp>;rt="temperature-c";if="sensor",

   An sdfProperty that is used to describe an SDF affordance that is
   intended to hold a link like this (without getting specific on the
   actual link to the link target) could look like:

   {
    "sdfProperty": {
     "temp-c-link": {
      "type": "object",
      "sdfType": "link",
      "properties": {
        "href": { "type": "string"},
        "rt": { "type": "string", "const": "temperature-c"},
        "if": { "type": "string", "const": "sensor"}
      }
     }
    }
   }

3.  Discussion

   Links play an important role in SDF modeling both during definition
   time (for adding information to a model, such as in sdfRef) and
   during run time (for making links to instances into a subject of data
   and interaction modeling).  The present document is an early attempt
   at addressing the run-time usage of links, in particular links that
   fit the Web Linking [RFC8288] abstractions.  A related draft
   [I-D.laari-asdf-relations] addresses definition-time links, but does
   seem to touch modeling run-time use of links as well (e.g., by
   discussing "writable" link relations).

   Not all links used in ecosystems are based on URIs.  E.g., OMA has
   "object links", which are pairs of numbers (object/instance).  These
   ecosystem links may have some structure that should be modeled in the
   SDF model (e.g., where the object id part of a link always has to
   have a specific value).  This structure can be mapped into URI
   strings using some convention, e.g., an OMA object link could be oma-
   object:3303:0 (where oma-object is placeholder for a URI scheme to be
   defined).  However, burying structural components of the ecosystem-
   specific link in a string syntax makes it hard to access and control
   those components from the model.

   TODO: Examples are needed to show how the OCF collection pattern is
   addressed by the current specification.

4.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations of [RFC8288] apply in a general way,
   although modeling a link as a datatype does not incur all of the
   security considerations that will apply to actually interchanging
   these links.

   (TODO)

5.  IANA Considerations

   // RFC Ed.: please replace RFC XXXX with this RFC number and remove
   this note.

   IANA is requested to register the sdfType "link" in the "sdfType
   Values" sub-registry in the "SDF Parameters" registry, with the
   following completion for the registration template:

     +======+=============+========+=====================+===========+
     | Name | Description | type   | JSON Representation | Reference |
     +======+=============+========+=====================+===========+
     | link | A Web Link  | object | object members for  | RFCXXXX   |
     |      | [RFC8288]   |        | link attributes     |           |
     +------+-------------+--------+---------------------+-----------+
