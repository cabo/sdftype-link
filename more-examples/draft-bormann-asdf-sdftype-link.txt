1.  Introduction

   The Semantic Definition Format for Data and Interactions of Things
   (SDF, [I-D.ietf-asdf-sdf]) is a format for domain experts to use in
   the creation and maintenance of data and interaction models in the
   Internet of Things.

   A common data type that occurs in the modeling of IoT devices is the
   _link_. [RFC8288] defines the concept of Web Linking, which, apart
   from the target URI that any link will contain, can provide
   additional parameters, such as the "link relation type" that explains
   the relationship expressed by the link, as well as "target
   attributes" that provide additional information about the target of
   the link (without a need to "dereference", i.e., follow, the link).

Internet-Draft              sdfType for Links                  June 2025


   This document defines and registers an sdfType "link" for the
   Semantic Definition Format.  This type models an abstract
   "serialization" [RFC8288] of a link, in a way that is compatible with
   the way SDF maps information models to its data modeling language.

1.1.  Conventions and Definitions

   The definitions of [RFC6690], [RFC8288], and [I-D.ietf-asdf-sdf]
   apply.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [BCP14] (RFC2119) (RFC8174) when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  The sdfType "link"

   The sdfType "link" is intended to be used with the SDF "type" of
   "object".  The members of that object are strings that are named the
   same as the link parameter (attribute) names.  The special parameter
   name "href" is used to express the link target.  (Parameter names
   specific to the Constrained RESTful Environment (CoRE) are also
   discussed in [RFC9423].)

   Note that attribute names and relation type names are case-
   insensitive in [RFC8288].  Strings that are case-insensitive in
   [RFC8288] MUST be in their lowercase form when used in this
   specification.

   An example for the instance of a link is provided in Section 5 of
   [RFC6690]:

      </sensors/temp>;rt="temperature-c";if="sensor",

   To hold a link like this, we could describe an SDF affordance that is
   specific on the target attributes above, but does not contain
   instance-specific (run-time) information on the actual URI that
   points to the link target.  An sdfProperty for that could look like:

   {
    "sdfProperty": {
     "temp-c-link": {
      "type": "object",
      "sdfType": "link",
      "properties": {
        "href": { "type": "string"},
        "rt": { "type": "string", "const": "temperature-c"},
        "if": { "type": "string", "const": "sensor"}
      }
     }
    }
   }

   Further examples that show sdfType "link" in context are in
   Appendix A.

3.  Discussion

   Links play an important role in SDF modeling both during definition
   time (for adding information to a model, such as in sdfRef) and
   during run time (for making links to instances into a subject of data
   and interaction modeling).  The present document is an early attempt
   at addressing the run-time usage of links, in particular links that
   fit the Web Linking [RFC8288] abstractions.  A related draft
   [I-D.laari-asdf-relations] addresses definition-time links, but does
   seem to touch modeling run-time use of links as well (e.g., by
   discussing "writable" link relations).

   Not all links used in ecosystems are based on URIs.  E.g., OMA has
   "object links", which are basically pairs of numbers (object/
   instance).  These ecosystem links may have some structure that should
   be modeled in the SDF model (e.g., where the object id part of a link
   always has to have a specific value).  This structure can be mapped
   into URI strings using some convention, e.g., an OMA object link
   could be oma-object:3303:0 (where oma-object is placeholder for a URI
   scheme to be defined).  However, burying structural components of the
   ecosystem-specific link in a string syntax makes it hard to access
   and control those components from the model.

   TODO: Examples are needed to show how the OCF collection pattern is
   addressed by the current specification.

4.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations of [RFC8288] apply in a general way,
   although modeling a link as a datatype does not incur all of the
   security considerations that will apply to actually interchanging
   these links.

   (TODO)

5.  IANA Considerations

   // RFC Ed.: please replace RFC XXXX with this RFC number and remove
   this note.

   IANA is requested to register the sdfType "link" in the "sdfType
   Values" sub-registry in the "SDF Parameters" registry, with the
   following completion for the registration template:

     +======+=============+========+=====================+===========+
     | Name | Description | type   | JSON Representation | Reference |
     +======+=============+========+=====================+===========+
     | link | A Web Link  | object | object members for  | RFCXXXX   |
     |      | [RFC8288]   |        | link attributes     |           |

Appendix A.  Examples

   sdfType "link" can be used to specify links with information specific
   to an organization's ecosystem.  In many cases, sdfRef (see
   Section 4.4 of [I-D.ietf-asdf-sdf]) provides a convenient way to
   assemble the link specification from elements that are generic for an
   organization and elements that are specific to the model being
   defined.

      |  Note that sdfRef operates by applying the JSON Merge Patch
      |  algorithm [RFC7396] to patch the contents of the definition
      |  found at the global name (see Section 4 of [I-D.ietf-asdf-sdf])
      |  with the contents of the original JSON map, i.e., the
      |  definition containing the sdfRef quality with the entry for the
      |  sdfRef quality removed.  The result of that Merge Patch is then
      |  used in place of the value of the original JSON map.

A.1.  Constructing a Link from an Organization's Ecosystem

   If the organization example.com provides a definition for an idlink
   that is intended to be referenced to obtain more information about
   the sdfObject myObj, this could look like:

   {
     "namespaces": {
       "org": "https://models.example.com/",
       "orgtypes": "https://models.example.com/#/sdfData/"
     },
     "defaultNamespace": "org",
     "sdfObject": {
       "myObj": {
         "sdfProperty": {
           "linkToInformation": {
             "description": "More info about foo",
             "sdfRef": "orgtypes:idlink"
           }
         }
       }
     }
   }

   This example assumes example.com has exported a definition for idlink
   such as the following:

A.2.  Using with OMA test object

   As a more specific example, the following assumes that
   openmobilealliance.org has provided a definition under objlink for
   the Object Links defined for LWM2M.
   // Add reference!

   The following is a potential definition that openmobilealliance.org
   could export that provides sdfRef-friendly descriptions of LWM2M core
   links as well as the more LWM2M specific object links:
